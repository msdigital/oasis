## Live Map for Farming Simulator 22

While playing Farming Simulator 19, i was wondering if it's possible to have some kind of "out of game" live map.  
After some quick research (basically clicking through the dedicated server administration, i found some xml files with interesting informations.  
And here we are... "Oasis" a Farming Simulator Live Map.

### How-To: Contribute new Translations

1. Create a new branch called "Translation-XX" and replace XX with the corresponding language code (eg. "Translation-DE" for german or "EN" for english)
2. Duplicate one of the existing language files (best "en.json" or "de.json") in the "server/locales" folder and rename it with the same language code (eg "de")
3. Translate :)
4. Commit your translations and create a pull-request and add msdigital as a reviewer
5. Done

Thanks for your contribution! I will check the translations and add them to a release package from time to time.

## Prerequisites

* node > 16.16.0
* npm > 8.11.0
* Farming Simulator 22 Server ;)

Works best on linux hosts ;)

## Run Oasis locally

### Installation

1. Get the [latest](https://github.com/msdigital/oasis/releases/latest) relase version
2. Extract zip file
3. Open a new terminal inside the folder
4. Run `npm install` and let npm do the rest :)

### Run Oasis

The configuration is pretty easy.  
Just provide the following settings as environment variables to your node process  
_or_  
This app uses dotenv, just create an `.env` file in the root folder and add the following variables to it.

| Variable  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| WEB_PORT  | The port the app will use to run (ex. 3000)  |
| SERVER_IP  | The game server ip and port (ex. 127.0.0.1:1234)  |
| SERVER_KEY  | Some kind of secret key, should look something like this "fGL0Dayr"  |
| DEFAULT_LANGUAGE  | Default language in 2 char iso format. Currently supported: en, de  |

You may find your servers IP and key in the Dedicated Server Administration under Settings ->Miscellaneous.  
If you, for example, take a look at the Link XML, you will see the IP, Port and the "code" which is used in this project as SERVER_KEY.
